## How will I know what to work on?

First, you wll be assigned a macrodata file. This selection has been made carefully by your superior.

After opening your file you will be met with a sea of numbers that seems to stretch endlessly in all directions.

Over tie, certain clusters of numbers will start to make you feel a certain way.

There are four categories of umbers, each of which elicits a different feeling. A refiner's job is to fill each of the five bins evely with the four kinds of number clusters.

Once every bin is properly filled, the file is 100% refined and the job is done.
